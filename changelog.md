# Changelog

## v1.2.21

*   Update the package used for enrichment analysis to use ClusterProfiler
*   Update visualization of enrichment analysis results : add dotplot and barplot provided by ClusterProfiler
*   Add more parameters to control the density plot of distances
*   Fix issues from Github

## v1.2.2

*   Replace the C code for DBF function by a R implementation to reduce the computational time.
*   Split the main R script into sub-script related to each function of scigenex package.

## v1.1.2

*   Create plot_heatmap function to generate an interactive heatmap of the gene clusters
*   Modify NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION file and add import_package.R files to automatically update dependencies using roxygen2::roxygenise()
*   Create top_genes function to find the top n genes from each signature. This function is also usefull for the plot_heatmap function.
*   Add a slot in the ClusterSet object containing the filename of the output file including simulated distances and cutting threshold.
*   Modify the input of plot_dist function to a ClusterSet object.
*   Update enric_analysis function : run the functional enrichment analysis for each gene cluster.
*   Remove R implementation of MCL. The package used is no more maintained and the released version needs to be fixed.
