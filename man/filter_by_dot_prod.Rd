\title{Filter cluster from a ClusterSet object using dot product.}
\usage{
filter_by_dot_prod(object = NULL, av_dot_prod_min = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A ClusterSet object.}

\item{av_dot_prod_min}{Any cluster with average dot product below this value is discarded. This allow to delete
clusters in which correlation is influenced/supported by very few samples (typically 1).}
}
\description{
This function filters clusters of gene expression data based 
on their dot products. It aims to remove clusters that have a 
lot of zeros and are supported by only a few cells or spots. 
To do this, the function first converts the gene expression 
data for each cluster into a binary form (values greater than 
1 are set to 1). Then it calculates the dot product for this 
binary matrix, which produces a gene-gene matrix showing the 
number of cells/spots where each pair of genes are expressed 
together. The function then calculates the median value of the 
maximum concordances across all genes, which can be used to 
determine whether a cluster should be filtered out or not.
